        <p>Choosing methods can be difficult. There are many different design research methods and just as many reasons
            why one
            method may be better suited for your project than others. The Development Oriented Triangulation (DOT) â€“
            Framework
            offers a good way to understand the differences and similarities between many design research methods. This
            cmdmethods card set and the DOT-framework form a perfect couple. Understanding the framework will help you
            to use
            the card set in a better way and the card set aids your understanding of the framework. In this mini-manual
            we give
            a brief introduction to the DOT-Framework and the use of this card set.</p>

        <h2>Two (plus one) innovation contexts</h2>
        <p>CMD projects typically strive for novel things of high quality such as webdesigns, applications or services.
            Design
            research methods are needed to advance these quests for novelty and quality. During a design project you
            typically
            try to learn about three things.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                You may want to know what has already been done by others. This includes not only all existing products
                or
                writings about these products, but also the responsible experts and authors. You could look at the
                competition,
                try to find best practices or design guidelines to make sure you design is indeed new and in some ways
                better
                than what has come before. Activities include reading, experiencing the existing work for yourself, and
                consulting with experts. When asking questions during these activities the DOT-Framework claims you are
                investigating the context of available work.
            </li>
            <li>
                You may want to know about those people who are going to use your product and/or the context where your
                product
                will be in use. You might want to investigate the work processes you need to support or the people who
                are going
                to be your customers. Activities include observing, mapping out the context of use, and consulting your
                target
                group. When you are asking questions about (future) use of your product, you are investigating the
                application
                context according to the DOT-Framework.
            </li>
            <li>
                Rather than the former two you might want to investigate your solution itself. You can research
                possibilities.
                Maybe you want to explore and compare several ways of solving the problem with ideation or prototyping
                techniques. During these activities you can include your target group as well as experts. According to
                the
                DOT-framework you are now researching the innovation space.
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Five research strategies.</h2>

        <p>So during a project you try to learn as much as you can about the context of available work, the application
            context
            and the innovation space. What are ways of learning these things? The DOT-Framework has 5 research
            strategies.</p>

        <section class="library">

                advent of the internet library research is also called desk research.</p>
        </section>

                possible and how things could work.</p>

        <section class="showroom">

            <h3>Showroom</h3>

            <p><img src="/img/logo-showroom.png" alt="Showroom" class="logo float-left">Showroom research is done to

                spelling out how your product is different from the competition. </p>
        </section>

        <h2>Trade-offs & triangulation</h2>
        <p>All types of methods can be important in design, but you can't use all in each project. To help you choose
            your
            methods strategically the DOT-framework has three axes which indicate important tradeoffs that you face when
            choosing one method over the other. Ideally you choose a method-mix which combines methods from both ends of
            the
            trade-off. This is called triangulation.</p>

        <h3>Overview or Certainty.</h3>
        <p>On the top of the DOT-framework we find field and library. These strategies help you to get an overview of
            the
            situation you are designing in. They have an orienting and often explorative character. The perfect result
            is a
            complete picture of the situation. A risk of this kind of overview is losing the specifics of your intended
            innovation due to new or additional options you continually encounter. The key is to keep focus. Most lab
            and
            showroom methods in contrast revolve around specific hypotheses or aspects of the design. They help you to
            be
            certain that somethings works or to identify cause and effect. The cost of trying to be certain is however
            that you
            can only test a few aspects of the design: you lose overview. In a larger project it is good practice to
            combine
            methods that optimize overview with those optimizing certainty.</p>

        <h3>Fit or Expertise.</h3>
        <p>On the right side of the DOT-framework we find library and showroom. These methods are concerned with reusing
            what is
            already done and advancing the state of the art. This focus on reuse and reusability is sometimes called
            rigor and
            builds upon existing expertise. On the left side of the DOT-framework we find field and lab. These
            strategies help
            you to get to know the application context better. If you want your design to be fit for use, these
            strategies are
            your best friend. This focus on fitness for use is sometimes called relevance. If you spend too much time
            looking at
            what has been done, you might lose touch with what is needed. If you spend all your time researching what is
            needed,
            you are reinventing the wheel. Ideally you choose a combination of methods stretching expertise and fit.</p>

        <h3>Inspiration or data.</h3>
        <p>Some methods such as A/B testing or Surveys are very data oriented. They often aim at objectivity and at
            results
            which are independent of the researchers. Other methods such as cultural probes or ideation techniques are
            inspiration oriented. They do not mind the results are subjective as long as they carry rich insights that
            further
            the design. Focusing on data oriented methods only will give your design research credibility but may create
            a
            distance that hinders a creative spark and lead to design without a soul. Focusing on inspiration oriented
            methods
            only may lead your very inspired design, which loses touch with other stakeholders. It may need a reality
            check. Our
            advice is thus to combine inspiration and data oriented methods.</p>

        <h2>How to use this set.</h2>
        <p>You can use this card set in many ways. It is really up to you! But some suggestions may be in place.</p>
        <dl>
            <dt>Negative selection</dt>
            <dd>
                <ol>
                    <li>Put all cards in front of you so you can see all cards.</li>
                    <li>Remove half of the cards, which are not applicable for your project for some reason.</li>
                    <li>Repeat b until you have a balanced and feasible set of methodcards.</li>
                </ol>
            </dd>
            <dt>Triangulation.</dt>
            <dd>
                <ol>
                    <li>Pick one card random from the set.</li>
                    <li>Imagine the type of results you would get from this method at the beginning of the set.</li>
                    <li>Choose a card that ensures optimal triangulation (across the tradeoffs).</li>
                    <li>Repeat last two steps until you have all the results you need for the project.</li>
                </ol>
            </dd>

            <dt>Foursome game (for teams)</dt>
            <dd>
                <ol>
                    <li>Shake the cards and give each player four cards. The rest of the cards go on a stack.</li>
                    <li>One team member starts playing. If the four cards in his hands do not represent optimal
                        triangulation he
                        tries to exchange a card with a partner by asking for specific card.</li>
                    <li>If the player does not have the card. Lay off one card beneath the stack and pick a new one.
                        When laying
                        off the cards, explain why this one has to go.</li>
                    <li>Turn is to the next player. Repeat steps until one has four cards which he regards as optimal.
                        He has to
                        defend the optimality of the set to his group.</li>
                </ol>
            </dd>
