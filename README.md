## :cherry_blossom: Features

This webapplication was build using:

- HTML, CSS and Javascript

- The [Express Framework](https://expressjs.com/) for building a Webser using [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)

- [EJS](https://ejs.co/) Emmbedded Javascript Templating Language

The webapplication does NOT have:

- A Content Management System (CMS): most of the content can be found in a [card-contents.json](card-contents.json) file. Maybe in future we will add a database and a CMS, but since the content stays relatively stable, it has not been a priority untill now
